<p class="inline-header">1. Licence</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Depositor grants the Repository a non-exclusive licence for digital data files, hereafter referred to as 'dataset'.</li>
    <li>The Repository is authorised to include the dataset in its data archive. The Repository shall transfer the content of the dataset to an available carrier, through any method and in any form.</li>
    <li>The Repository is authorised to make the dataset (or substantial parts thereof) available to third parties by means of on-line transmission. In addition, the Repository has the right, on the instruction of third parties or otherwise, to make a copy of the dataset or to grant third parties permission to download a copy.</li>
</ol>

<p class="inline-header">2. The Depositor</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Depositor declares that he is a holder of rights to the dataset, or the only holder of rights to the dataset, under the Databases act (<em>Databankenwet</em>) and where relevant the Copyright Act (<em>Auteurswet</em>) or otherwise, and/or is entitled to act in the present matter with the permission of other parties that hold rights.</li>
    <li>The Depositor indemnifies the Repository against all claims made by other parties against the Repository with regard to the dataset, the transfer of the dataset, and the form and/or content of the dataset.</li>
</ol>

<p class="inline-header">3. The Repository</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Repository shall ensure, to the best of its ability and resources, that the deposited dataset is archived in a sustainable manner and remains legible and accessible.</li>
    <li>The Repository shall, as far as possible, preserve the dataset unchanged in its original software format, taking account of current technology and the costs of implementation. The Repository has the right to modify the
        format and/or functionality of the dataset if this is necessary in order to facilitate the digital sustainability, distribution or re-use of the dataset.</li>
    <li>If the access categories “Restricted Access” or “Other Access”, as specified at the end of this Agreement, are selected, the Repository shall, to the best of its ability and resources, ensure that effective technical and other measures are in place to prevent unauthorised third parties from gaining access to and/or consulting the dataset or substantial parts thereof.</li>
</ol>

<p class="inline-header">4. The dataset</p>
<ol>
    <li>The dataset to which the licence relates is specified in the appendix to this Agreement. The appendix forms an integral part of this Agreement.</li>

<p class="inline-header">5. Removal of datasets / changes to access conditions </p>
<ol>
    <li>The Repository may decide not to make the dataset available to third parties for a temporary period or permanently as well as to remove the dataset from the archive wholly or in part. The Repository is entitled to do so if a Depositor has submitted a request stating the reasons for this action. In the case of not making the dataset available, the Repository shall retain the dataset in the data archive, but shall no longer allow third parties to access the dataset or substantial parts thereof.</li>
    <li>If sufficient weighty grounds exist, the Repository has the right to remove the dataset from the archive wholly or in part, or to restrict or prevent access to the dataset on a temporary or permanent basis. The Repository shall inform the Depositor in such cases.</li>
</ol>

<p class="inline-header">6. Availability to third parties:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Repository shall make the dataset available to third parties in accordance with the access conditions agreed with the Depositor: “Open Access”, “Open Access for Registered Users”, “Restricted Access” or “Other Access”. Access conditions may vary between parts of the dataset.</li>
    <li>The Repository shall make the dataset available to third parties with whom they have reached agreement on the General Conditions for Use only if agreement has been reached with the Depositor on one of the following access categories: “Open Access for Registered Users”, “Restricted Access” or “Other Access”. Unless agreed otherwise with the Depositor, the use of datasets is subject to the General Conditions of Use laid down by the Repository. When the “Open Access” access category is agreed, the dataset shall be made available to third parties without the Depositor necessarily agreeing on the General Conditions for Use with said third parties.</li>
    <li>If the access category “Restricted Access” has been agreed, the Repository shall make the dataset (or parts thereof) available only to the persons and/or organisations specified by the Depositor.</li>
    <li>If a dataset (or parts thereof) to which the access categories “Restricted Access” or “Other Access” apply contain, as evidenced by the specification provided by the Depositor, personal data as referred to in the Personal Data Protection Act of The Netherlands (WBP; <em>Wet Bescherming Persoonsgegevens</em>, Act of 6 July 2000, Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 302, Article 9 paragraph 3 and Article 23 paragraph 2), the Repository shall make the dataset (or parts thereof) available only if this is permitted by law, which in any case should be taken to include making the dataset (or parts thereof) available for the purpose of historical, statistical or scientific research.</li>
    <li>Notwithstanding the above, the Repository can make the dataset (or substantial parts thereof) available to third parties:
        <ul>
            <li>if the Repository is required to do so by legislation or regulations, a court decision, or by a regulatory or other institution</li>
            <li>if this is necessary for the preservation of the dataset and/or the data archive</li>
            <li>(to a similar institution) if the Repository ceases to exist and/or its activities in the field of data-archiving are terminated</li>
        </ul>
	</li>
    <li>The Repository shall publish the documentation, hereafter referred to as metadata, as provided by the Depositor with the dataset, and make this freely available.

<p class="inline-header">7. Provisions relating to use by third parties</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Repository shall require third parties to whom the dataset (or substantial parts thereof) is made available to include in the research results a clear reference to the dataset from which data have been used. The reference must comply with the DANS General Conditions of Use. This obligation does not apply if the “Open Access” access category has been agreed on. In that case, the Repository will make every effort to inform third parties that they should include in their research results in whatever form, a clear acknowledgement of the source of the datasets from which data have been used.</li>
    <li>The Repository shall oblige any party or parties to which it makes the dataset available to respect any copyright or database rights relating to the dataset.</li>
</ol>

<p class="inline-header">8. Death of the Depositor or Discontinuance of the Depositor's organisation</p>
<p>From the time that the Depositor dies or in the event that the Depositor's organisation ceases to exist and no notice of termination in accordance with Article 10 has been given and if no legal successors, other parties that hold rights to the dataset or other persons mentioned in the field Rights Holder or in the field Creator of the metadata relating to the dataset, as defined in article 6.f, are known to DANS, the Repository shall be entitled to do whatever it considers reasonable in order to realise its objectives.</p>

<p class="inline-header">9. Liability</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Repository accepts no liability in the event that all or part of a dataset is lost.</li>
    <li>The Repository accepts no liability for any damage or losses resulting from acts or omissions by third parties to whom the Repository has made the dataset available.</li>
</ol>

<p class="inline-header">10. Term, cancellation and termination of the Agreement</p>
<ol>
    <li>This Agreement shall come into effect on the date on which the Repository publishes the dataset (hereafter the date of publication) and shall remain valid for an indefinite period. If the repository decides not to include the dataset in its data archive, this Agreement is cancelled. The Repository notifies the Depositor of publication or non-inclusion of the dataset in its data archive. Cancellation of this Agreement is subject to a period of notice of six months, and notice shall be given in writing. It is possible to change the agreed access category at any time during the term of the Agreement.</li>
    <li>Notwithstanding point (a), this Agreement shall end when the dataset is removed from the data archive in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement.</li>
    <li>If the Repository ceases to exist or terminates its data-archiving activities, the Repository shall attempt to transfer the data files to a similar organisation that will continue the Agreement with the Depositor under similar conditions if possible.</li>
