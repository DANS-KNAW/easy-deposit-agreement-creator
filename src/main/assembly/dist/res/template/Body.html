            <li>The Depositor declares to be the sole entitled party with regard to the intellectual property rights to the Dataset pursuant to, but not limited to, the Database Act, the Copyright Act and other relevant legislation, and/or to act with the permission of the titleholder(s) or co-titleholder(s).</li>
            <li>The Depositor will indemnify the Depositary against all claims that others may make against the Depositary with regard to the Dataset or the deposit thereof, its format and/or contents or its availability for further research.</li>
            <li>The Depositor confirms that the Dataset does not contain any data or other elements which, in isolation or upon disclosure outside the context of scientific research, are inconsistent with the Dutch Penal Code or other relevant national or international legislation.</li>

    <li>
        <p>Depositary</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Depositary will, to the best of its ability and resources, permanently archive the Dataset, preserving its readability and accessibility.</li>
            <li>The Depositary will archive the Dataset unaltered and in its original software format as far as possible, taking into account the technological state of the art and the cost of implementation.

            <li>If the Dataset has been assigned to the “Restricted Access” category, the Depositary will, to the best of its ability and resources, ensure effective technical provisions to prevent unauthorized third parties from accessing and/or consulting substantial parts of the Dataset.</li>
            <li>The Depositor will remain the controller of the Dataset within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) insofar as the Dataset contains personal data within the meaning of the GDPR. The Depositary will be a processor within the meaning of the GDPR. If the Dataset contains personal data, the Depositor and the Depositary will conclude a processing agreement, except in the case of bibliographical data which exclusively refer to personal data that are necessary for the accountability of the Dataset, such as its creator, rights holders and citations (hereinafter: “Bibliographical Data”).</li>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Dataset</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Dataset will consist of all the files transferred by the Depositor and the metadata provided by the Depositor. Metadata is understood to mean the contents of all fields that must be completed in the archival system at the time of deposit in order to describe the Dataset.</li>
            <li>The Depositor declares that the Dataset corresponds to the metadata provided by the Depositor.</li>
            <li>The Dataset shall be compiled with due observance of the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, the GDPR and other applicable laws and regulations.</li>

            <li>The Depositor will provide the files in a preferred format, as defined on the Depositary's website at the time of deposit. In the event that a format is not defined as a preferred format, the Depositor will contact the Depositary before delivery.

            <li>The Depositor will provide documentation with the Dataset that explains its creation, contents and any specific values (such as codes, characters and abbreviations), its structure (such as folder structures and relationships between files) and its actual use (such as that of software) to third parties.</li>
            <li>The Depositor will make the Dataset available to the Depositary in a manner and through a medium that the Depositary deems suitable.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Removing the Dataset and/or changing its accessibility</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Depositor may submit a reasoned request to the Depositary to make the Dataset temporarily or permanently unavailable to third parties or to remove it entirely or partly from the archival system. The Depositary will assess the request in view of its objective. In cases where the Dataset contains personal data, the Depositary will assess the request with due observance of the GDPR.</li>
            <li>If there are compelling reasons to do so, the Depositary has the right to remove the Dataset, or part of it, from the archival system, or to limit or exclude access to it temporarily or permanently. In such cases, the Depositary will reasonably inform the Depositor.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Availability to third parties</p>
        <ol>
            <li>All or part of the Dataset files will be made available to third parties in accordance with one or more access categories agreed with the Depositor: “Open Access” or “Restricted Access”, possibly with the addition of an embargo (see Appendix 1). If Restricted Access is applied, part of the files may be made available directly to third parties, in consultation with the Depositary.</li>
            <li>If Open Access is applied, the Depositor determines whether the files in the Dataset are placed in the public domain or whether a licence (hereinafter: “Open Access Licence”) shall apply (see Appendix 1).</li>
            <li>If the Open Access category has been agreed with the Depositor, the Depositary will make the Dataset available directly to third parties, providing either the public domain statement or the agreed Open Access Licence.</li>
            <li>The Open Access Licence provided for the Open Access category by the Depositor will apply to all files and their contents, to the extent that they are protected by copyright. The Depositary will make the Dataset as a whole, as well as its content or parts of its content, available under the conditions of the specified licence.</li>
            <li>If the files in the Dataset, or parts of them, contain personal data within the meaning of the GDPR, the Restricted Access category will be applied exclusively and the files will not be made available directly to third parties.</li>
            <li>If the Depositor and Depositary agree on Restricted Access, the following shall apply:
                <ol>
                    <li>The Depositary will make the files in the Dataset, or parts of them, exclusively available to users registered with the Depositary with whom they have agreed the DANS Licence (see Appendix 2) (hereinafter: “Users”). The Depositor has taken note of the DANS Licence and agrees to make the Dataset available in accordance with this licence. The Depositor is free to impose further conditions on Users prior to making the Dataset available.</li>
                    <li>In addition to the aforementioned provisions, the Depositary will only make the files in the Dataset, or parts of them, available to Users who have submitted a permission request for access to the Dataset and who have subsequently been granted such permission by the Depositor.</li>
                    <li>If a Dataset with Restricted Access includes files which the Depositor wishes to provide without the required permission as referred to under (b), the Depositary shall make the files directly available to third parties at the request of the Depositor, referring to the DANS Licence.</li>
                    <li>The Depositor will ensure the availability of a stable email address and check it regularly so that permission requests can be processed within a reasonable period of time.</li>
                    <li>The Depositary will facilitate consultations between the Depositor and the User who wants to use a Dataset, but cannot be held responsible for the Depositor’s decision whether or not to make the Dataset available, nor for any conditions under which this is done.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <li>The Depositor will notify the Depositary as soon as possible of a failure to cite the source or an infringement of copyright or database rights as referred to in this article, to allow the Depositary to take the measures that it deems necessary, including, but not limited to, exclusion from further use of Datasets.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Death of the Depositor or liquidation of its organisation</p>
        <p>Upon the death of the Depositor or the liquidation or termination of its organisation, if no legal successors or co-entitled parties are known to the Depositary, the Depositary will be entitled to do whatever it deems reasonably necessary with a view to achieving its objective. In the event that the Dataset contains personal data within the meaning of the GDPR, the Depositary will request another organisation to act as the Depositor. This request will only be made to an organisation established in the Netherlands that, according to its statutes or by law, has scientific research, or the support or promotion of it, among its core tasks and/or objectives.</p>
